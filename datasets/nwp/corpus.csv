"One day the kingdom's peaceful existence was shattered when a fearsome dragon descended from the mountains laying waste to villages and demanding tribute."
"The people were terrified and the king desperate to protect his subjects called upon Sir Cedric to vanquish the beast."
"Without hesitation Sir Cedric accepted the challenge."
"He mounted Thunder armed himself with his enchanted sword and set off toward the dragon’s lair."
"The journey was arduous with treacherous paths and wild creatures but Sir Cedric's determination never wavered."

"Summoning all his courage Sir Cedric managed to outmaneuver the dragon finding an opening and delivering a decisive strike."
"The dragon roared one final time before collapsing its once-mighty flames extinguished."
"The kingdom rejoiced as Sir Cedric returned triumphant."
"The people hailed him as a hero and the king bestowed upon him the highest honors."
"Sir Cedric ever humble reminded everyone that bravery and honor come from the heart not from titles or trophies."
"From that day forward Sir Cedric's legend grew not just for his victory over the dragon but for his selflessness and the spirit of courage he embodied."
"And though his adventures were many he always remembered that true heroism lay in protecting those who could not protect themselves and standing firm in the face of darkness."
"And so the kingdom thrived in peace with Sir Cedric’s story becoming a beacon of hope and bravery for generations to come."
"Dear customer, are you here at Chioriya Boutique just to look at me instead of the clothes?"
"Is there something you need?"
"A meal together?"
"I'm not hungry now."
"Let me finish what I'm working on first."
"Then we can talk."
"Alright, drop the act."
"I can tell what you want to do."
"You prepared a birthday surprise for me, didn't you?"
"Next time, just tell me directly."
"There's no need to beat around the bush."
"To be honest I'm really happy."
"As the renowned President of the Spina di Rosula, isn't it normal that I receive so many gifts for my birthday?"
"This bottle of perfume looks great."
"Let me give it a try."
"Mm, it's like a sea breeze carrying the scent of roses."
"It suits my style perfectly, doesn't it?"
"I can tell that it's a gift from a friend who knows me well!"
"Let's see who's the sender."
"Haha, just kidding, I already knew it was you."
"You have excellent taste!"
"Dear Traveler, it's announcement time!"
"The special program for Genshin Impact's new version will premiere on the official Twitch and YouTube channels on 08/16/2024 at 12:00 AM (UTC-4)!"
"This special program will feature juicy details about new game content and developments in Version 5.0."
"It will also drop some redemption codes and other goodies!"
"Make sure to follow us, Traveler."
"We'll see you there!"
"Black Swan reveals a bone-chilling truth to you: It turned out the entire Express Crew, as well as everyone in Penacony, lost their lives in their battle against Sunday."
"There were no survivors."
"However, there is still a chance to turn this around."
"The Memokeeper points out that there is a fatal flaw in the story that you experienced."
"Behind this fatal flaw lies a glimmer of hope."
"Now, you have seen through the illusion of Ena's Dream..."
"However, if you wish to awaken everyone in Asdana, you will need far more people on your side..."
"The golden dream is about to become restless."
"In the long night that will follow, I fear that you may encounter countless setbacks and witness endless tragedies."
"In the end, only black and white will be left in your vision."
"But you must have faith."
"That black-and-white world will have a fleeting moment of crimson."
"But, when you make your decision..."
"...It will appear once again."
"And you, you must carefully ruminate on its meaning, then return to the waking world."
"We will find our answer there."
"In the first year of the AE 2158, a fiery conspiracy erupted in the Land of the Dreams, but soon faded in chaos and destruction."
"Whispers carried the tale of those fateful 48 system hours, when a sun teetered on the precipice of collapse, a paradise stood on the brink of destruction, and a world was poised to surrender to its new master."
"Amidst it all, a body decayed, a pack of vultures gathered, and a brother and sister were doomed for eternal separation."
"And so, an Aeon succumbed to slumber once more."
"Some celebrated this fall, while others mourned."
"Among the insignificant witnesses, mere specks in the vast tapestry of the universe, it was said that this time, the Aeon met THEIR demise with dignity."
"As the Cosmos bathed in the radiance of a pure dawn, a tempestuous storm brewed on the horizon."
"The chant of 'Everything for the Amber Lord' grew ever louder."
"Yet, no matter how one contemplates it, time inexorably swings Qlipoth's colossal hammer in eternal cycles."
"The tale of the Astral Express reaches both its conclusion and a new beginning."
"Time marches forward, heralding the arrival of a new chapter in the history of Trailblazing expeditions."
"Dear Traveler, the time has come to bid farewell to the Astral Express."
"May the memories of your journey remain etched in your heart forever."
"Thank you for joining us on this unforgettable adventure."
"Until we meet again, Traveler."
"May the stars guide you on your next voyage."
"Robin, is that you singing...?"
"Brother, you have heard their cries... "
"This is not the paradise they hoped for."
"Even so, they don't know where they should be heading."
"That's why... I had to become the lone star in the sky to guide them."
"Even if that star... must hang in a perpetual night of solitude?"
"Brother... The weakness of humanity cannot be redeemed by others."
"Even if the future is full of pain... we won't escape from it!"
"You have a noble soul... Don't be shackled by the past!"
"Witness... the will of the weak!"
"If we had never experienced solitude, how could we have embarked on different paths?"
"Now, our final talk has concluded."
"All the work of creation has been completed."
"The inevitable day has arrived..."
"The Embryo of Philosophy..."
"will reshape for us all of reality!"
"An ex-surveyor aboard the Astral Express and a young scholar, brimming with enthusiasm and curiosity."
"Hailing from the Zorina-Urd system — enlightened by Remembrance and dominated by academic cliques — she majored in memoria dynamics."
"To seek out broader academic possibilities, she joined the crew of the Astral Express to build Asdana and launched her research into memoria."
"Towards the end of the War of Independence, she piloted a shuttle on her own and disappeared into the Memory Zone in search of secrets about the Primordial Dreamscape."
"Her research results formed the theoretical basis for the development of the entire Penacony to this day, creating a profound impact on the affluence of later generations."
"She was the true founder behind the Land of the Dreams."
"The former guard of the Astral Express and an outstanding gunslinger."
"Hailing from the frontier world of Frati, his worship of local legend Oakley the Musketeer saw him board the Astral Express."
"During the war, he was one of Penacony's most accomplished generals and the sole winner of the Fanghunter Medal — an award conferred by Hanunue himself."
"While reopening the silver rail with the Lampmoth Family during the civil war, he was ambushed by the Swarm and disappeared only to be rescued by the Galaxy Rangers."
"He fought in the crusade against Lord Ravager Zulo and managed to survive that gruesome battle, then disappeared out of sight completely."
"That was until the day a Self-Annihilator found his relics."
"Truly, he was a pure, noble, and selfless warrior."
"Former mechanic of the Astral Express, and the legendary big shot of Penacony, 'the Watchmaker.'"
"Hailing from the oceanic planet of Lushaka, he was adopted by legendary seafarers, the Mikhail-Char couple."
"It was just by happenstance that he boarded the Express, making many travel companions along the way while contributing greatly to the prosperity and development of Penacony."
"Beyond mechanical repairs, he often humbly claimed to possess few skills, except for his knack for spinning tales."
"'The Watchmaker' was his greatest lie of all, and Penacony's 'Festivities' was his final lie."
"He did not want his star to deviate from the path of freedom, so he intended to cleverly employ falsehoods and keep various Paths existing here for a long time."
"But he was unable to witness Penacony's end."
"He died a quiet death in a forgotten corner somewhere, with only a handful in attendance at his funeral."
"In line with the Nameless' tradition, his Crew ticket was returned to the starry seas."
"Meanwhile, Penacony remains resplendent in its glory, and the child's dream will continue in perpetuity."
"It's a pleasure to hear your voice again."
"Congratulations, you've become the... biggest winner of this festival."
"Are you just calling to poke fun at me?"
"No, I'm just impressed."
"Not only did you venture alone into Penacony and discover the truth of Dreamflux Reef, but you also managed to escape with the help of that Knight of Beauty..."
"Remember the recording you received from your Trailblaze friend?"
"It's now the most valuable chip in this game."
"However, this came at a high cost..."
"Losing a Cornerstone is a hefty price to pay."
"Diamond just called a meeting to discuss what to do with you."
"Just as I expected. So, is Diamond planning to demote me, or kick me out of the Ten Stonehearts?"
"Why don't you take a wild guess?"
"Well, alright. Then I'll guess... he's going to promote me to P46?"
"Alright, what will you wager?"
"Are we talking about an actual bet here? I don't wanna wager anything just so that you can swindle it all in the end."
"But if it's just a friendly bet, I'll put on the line what I did when we first met. I'll bet my life, ma'am."
"Interesting. But since it's Diamond's call, no one can predict the outcome."
"I'm on my way to Penacony. Once everyone is settled, we'll return to Pier Point for the final showdown."
"Sounds like I'll be out of the action for a while. Finally, a chance to kick back and relax?"
"Yeah, leave everything to me and Topaz, child."
"Thanks to you, as soon as the Jade Stone was delivered to The Family's compound, we finished up our preparations."
"The seeds we planted have taken root."
"Soon... it'll be time to 'reap' the rewards."
"...Huh?"
"Let's wrap it up for now."
"Looks like I've got a visitor here..."
"Oh? So many surprises today."
"Didn't expect a Galaxy Ranger and wanted criminal to show up here..."
"...One who managed to take out two IPC members under the noses of our fleet."
"Do you understand what that means?"
"Screwubbaboo, I just put them to sleep! Don't try to intimidate me with that nonsense."
"Besides, I've taken down more IPC lackeys than the residual value you've squeezed, and I don't mind adding a few more zeroes to my wanted poster."
"I have a question for you."
"Be honest now, or I won't think twice about puttin' a bullet in your fudgin' head."
"Tell me... Where is Oswaldo SchneiderHead of Marketing Development Department?"
"Oswaldo Schneider? I don't know him. I'm just a humble mechanic."
"I don't know anything about the Marketing Development Department."
"Really? You don't know him?"
"Then why did you just call him by his full name?"
"Because I'm a mechanic, and I know the names of all the employees in the company."
"But I don't know where they are or what they do."
"Alright, I'll take your word for it."
"But if you're lying, I'll be back to finish this conversation."
"Alright, I'll be waiting for you."
"But I hope you don't come back, because I don't like violence."
"Good. I hope you're telling the truth."
"I'll be back to check on you later."
"Sorry, I only just saw your message."
"Now that my mission on Penacony has come to an end, I can finally use my phone in the open."
"It felt like I was in jail."
"Glad to see you're safe and sound."
"Haha, you're so kind."
"Where have you been?"
"Long story. Let's save it for next time."
"Rest in peace! Guess it's over at last."
"Haha, this sounds more like you!"
"Since we've got nothing else going on, how about we play a simple dice game to keep our senses sharp?"
"If the number you roll is greater than or equal to mine, I'll tell you something that happened after the theme park incident."
"Sounds good. Let's begin!"
"Let's do it."
"Your turn. Your chances seem good."
"Doesn't matter to me anyway."
"How about one more round?"
"Nothing in the rules says we can't have a do-over."
"Let's do it again then."
"Spill it."
"How lucky."
"Give me a big one!"
"Mine's bigger, now spill it."
"After taking that one strike from that Emanator's blade, I waded into a river wider than any I've seen in my life."
"I thought I had reached the end of my life."
"But... as you can see, I'm still alive, and I'm happy about that."
"Your turn."
"I think I'm in luck."
"...And?"
"This is surely a win, right?"
"What happened next?"
"When you guys were unraveling the secrets beneath Penacony's surface, I already fell into the Primordial Dreamscape."
"The Preservation's Cornerstone shielded me from the contamination of the Nihility, but in doing so, it completely shattered to smithereens."
"Fortunately, I met a Knight of Beauty and narrowly escaped death with his help."
"It's your turn. We gotta follow through with this game."
"Luck is on your side."
"What happened after that?"
"You're doing great, my friend."
"Then, thanks to you lot, all the truths came to light."
"Topaz and Jade took over the affairs on Penacony, and now I get to enjoy some time off."
"But I've been having nightmares these past few days, waking up drenched in sweat every single time."
"Thankfully, the IPC has arranged for a Doctor of Chaos to give me a thorough examination, and things have improved."
"That's about it. You're really lucky to get me to tell the whole story."
"I knew you were losing on purpose from the get-go."
"There's no way you're that unlucky."
"Happy losing, huh? You've tricked me again."
"The Dreamscape may be a bustling place, but there aren't many 'friends'."
"I gotta find ways to make do, wouldn't you say?"
"Thanks for helping me through the tough times. Hope I wasn't a bother."
"Guess I'll find fun somewhere else, see ya."
"I'll pass."
"Oh, that's too bad, I thought you'd like it."
"Never mind, it's not that important anyway."
"Guess I'll find fun somewhere else, see ya."
"Welcome to Horizon of Existence..."
"This place is one of the thousands of manifestations belonging to the sleeping and shapeless IX, the Nihility, and it's also an exit out of the Nihility for the awake ones."
"Let's bid our final farewells here."
"Always distinguish between reality and imagination... alright, Gray?"
"Life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
"May your schemes... be forever concealed."
"Ena's Dream... is too cruel for him, and everyone else."
"To the imperfect tomorrow."
"I still remember the question on the invitation letter — Why does life slumber?"
"Why does life slumber...? We don't know the answer yet, but we're about to awaken from this dream."
"Or perhaps, such is the answer itself."
"Leave this place, return to where you belong, and... awaken Penacony from this dream."
"As I said, our plan is not about convincing everyone to choose the right path, but about inspiring them to save themselves."
"So, when will people actively save themselves?"
"The answer is... when they are in desperate situations."
"Like a drowning individual in the deep sea, when one's body and mind bear immense pressure, agony, confusion, and despair will follow."
"I firmly believe that..."
"The fragility of humankind often freezes them in their tracks, but in truly desperate situations they will strive to save themselves."
"And now... Penacony has enough heroes to lead them forward."
"It's through this inherent self-centered instinct that people exert their utmost effort, even when they know their struggle is fruitless."
"As absurd as it may seem, it's their resistance."
"As for now, (Trailblazer)... It is time to guide them, not as a savior, but as a Nameless among those mortals."
"In this way, you will reunite in the warmth of the sunlight."
"The rain... is intensifying. Before we part ways, please allow me to ask a few final questions."
"So far, you have forged unbreakable bonds with numerous individuals and entities in the sweet dream."
"Might I ask if you fear severing these bonds with your own hands?"
"If there is a vast, lifelike dreamland that is virtually indistinguishable from reality... a realm without death, where everyone can attain the happiness and fulfillment they deserve, living blissfully ever after."
"I would ask — Would you wish to stay?"
"Imagine if this splendid dream were fated to fall apart: Friends, family, strangers... followed by the gentle breeze, soaring birds, the stars... and ultimately, yourself."
"Everyone, and every face they remember, the joy and the heartaches, the vows sealed and those left hanging... all will inevitably march towards a predetermined ending."
"If you had grasped the journey's finale right from its inception..."
"I would ask — Would you still embark on this journey?"
"I'm glad. The answer itself doesn't matter. What matters is that you've made a decision."
"Listen, touch, and ponder, and therein lies the sensation. Cherish it, because that's what makes us exist."
"Such is the only answer humans can offer when facing the Nihility."
"If the Nihility represents the primal fear of life, rendering any lofty convictions insignificant under THEIR imposing shadow..."
"Then behind this shadow, there must exist the most fervent source of light in the world."
"Just as every life that edges closer to death fervently approaches the end of the Nihility..."
"We must pursue that primordial light."
"Now come to think that you exist in the Nihility, and you watch over others to depart it..."
"Such a task is absurd and meaningless."
"Nevertheless, someone has to do it. As for the meaning you mentioned..."
"Even if it's a meaningless task, I've come this far, haven't I?"
"Even if the future you forge may not even belong to you?"
"It may not belong to me, but it definitely belongs to someone."
"What hardships you must have experienced..."
"In that case, allow me to do something meaningless, too..."
"Please tell me your name."
"Perhaps my existence will vanish in the next moment... and nobody will remember this conversation or your answer..."
"But I believe... that your name should be remembered..."
"And this universe... will remember it as well."
"For me, some things are difficult to recall, yet there are others... that I find challenging to forget."
"Such is 'memory,' a creation of the past that blossoms into significance in the distant future."
"I remember that marks the start of my journey, the origin of the vibrant red hue in my life, and the most fervent element amidst every tempest..."
"That's my name..."
"Raiden Bosenmori Mei."
